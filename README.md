ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project: PDFify - a groundbreaking PDF chat application!

ðŸ“š Key Features:

User Accounts: Create your account and securely manage your PDFs.
Interactive PDF Chat: Upload your PDFs and chat with the bot to get answers to any queries related to the document.
Seamless Conversations: Engage in real-time conversations with your PDFs, making information retrieval effortless.
Chat History: Your chat history is stored, allowing you to pick up right where you left off.
ðŸ’¡ Tech Stack:

Frontend: Leveraged React.js for a dynamic interface, styled with Tailwind CSS, and managed state with Redux for a smooth user experience.
Backend: Built with Python and FastAPI, ensuring fast and reliable performance.
Database: Utilized MongoDB for robust data storage.
PDF Storage: Integrated Dropbox for secure and accessible PDF storage.
AI Integration: Powered by Googleâ€™s Gemini AI to deliver accurate and insightful responses.
This was my first venture into FastAPI, and the learning curve was steep but incredibly rewarding. The experience has enriched my skill set and opened up new possibilities for future projects.
